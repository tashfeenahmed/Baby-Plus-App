<div ng-init="friends = [{question:'When should I begin taking prenatal vitamins?', answer:'One of the most important things you can do to help prevent serious birth defects in your baby is to get enough folic acid every day especially before conception and during early pregnancy. Folic acid, sometimes called folate, is a B vitamin (B9) found mostly in leafy green vegetables like kale and spinach, orange juice, and enriched grains. The most common neural tube defects are spina bifida (an incomplete closure of the spinal cord and spinal column), anencephaly (severe underdevelopment of the brain), and encephalocele (when brain tissue protrudes out to the skin from an abnormal opening in the skull).

All of these defects occur during the first 28 days of pregnancy — usually before a woman even knows she is pregnant. That is why it is so important for all women of childbearing age to get enough folic acid — not just those who are planning to become pregnant.'},
                         
                         {question:'Can I dye my hair or perm it while I am pregnant?', answer:'It is perfectly safe to dye your hair and get perms while pregnant. There is no proof that it harms the baby.'},
                         {question:'Can I eat fish?', answer:'Certain types of fish that carry more mercury (swordfish, shark, king mackerel and tile fish) should be avoided. Store-bought fish sticks, and fast food fish sandwiches are low in mercury, as well as shrimp, light tuna, Pollock, and catfish. These are safe to eat up to 12 oz. per week.'},
                         {question:'Is it ok to continue my exercise routine?', answer:'It is safe to continue to do the same workouts you are used to as long as your doctor approves it. Eating well and exercising should always be a general part of overall health and it is also a great way to stay healthy and fit during your pregnancy. Horseback riding, downhill skiing, and mountain biking are exercises to avoid because there are always risk factors you may not be able to control. As always, talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program.'},
                         {question:'Is it normal to be exhausted during pregnancy?', answer:'This is totally normal, especially during the first trimester. Your body is going through so many changes and pregnancy puts a strain on your entire body. Hormonal changes, such as a dramatic rise in progesterone, can also be contributing to your feeling of being tired. If you are nauseated or vomiting and/or having trouble sleeping at night, those can also contribute to fatigue. Most women regain energy by the second trimester and then the fatigue can set in again towards the end around 7 months. To ease this, eat a healthy diet, get moderate exercise, and take time to relax.'},
                         {question:'Is there anything I can do to avoid stretch marks?', answer:'Unfortunately there isnt much you can do to avoid getting them. Not gaining more weight than the recommended amount (usually 25-35 pounds) can help. There isnt proof that any of the lotions or oils can prevent them but that does help to keep your belly moisturized to ease itching as your belly grows. Stretch marks do become less noticeable after about 6 months after childbirth and the pigmentation fades to a more natural skin tone rather than the purplish/red color they appear at first.'},
                         {question:'How can I sleep more comfortably?', answer:'Always make sure you are not sleeping on your back. When you lie on your back, your uterus may put pressure on your vena cava – a large blood vessel that runs up your back returning blood to your heart. This may make you feel dizzy and faint, and may reduce the flow of blood to your baby. Lying on your side with your knees bent is likely to be the most comfortable position as your pregnancy progresses. Try placing a pillow between your legs for added support.'},
                         {question:'When will I feel the baby move?', answer:'If this is your first pregnancy, you will most likely feel your baby move around 16-22 weeks, even though he/she has been moving around since about 7 or 8 weeks. Mothers who have been pregnant before may notice the movement sooner since she is familiar with the feeling. Some women have compared the feeling to a bubble popping in their stomach or butterflies fluttering. As pregnancy progresses, the kicks and movement will get stronger and more regular.'},
                         {question:'What does Islam teach in terms of food?', answer:'A foetus in its mothers womb, feeds and grows on the nourishment in her blood. Therefore, the mothers food should be nutritive enough to provide the elements needed by the baby as well as for the welfare of the mother. Therefore any lack of vitamins, proteins, fat, sugar or carbohydrates in the mothers intake of food would inflict harm on the babys health. Imam Sadiq (AS) stated: The food of a foetus, is provided by the nourishment that the mother receives. [256] A major problem which confronts most of the pregnant women is that during either the whole or the majority of the pregnancy period, they lack a well-balanced appetite for food, as they develop craving for certain foods while being repulsed by others. Because they generally eat less, during this period, they should make sure that their food is not stodgy and at the same time nutritious enough to provide the essentials for the baby. Following up a food program in this phase of pregnancy is extremely difficult, particularly for those of low income and those who are unaware of the nutritional values of different foods. A great responsibility rests with the father who should do his utmost to provide essential foods for his wife. Carelessness on the part of the father would be harmful to the growing baby, for which he would be held responsible in both this world and in the world Hereafter.'},
                         {question:'What does Islam say about fear of labor?', answer:'Delivering a baby is not always an easy event. Labour pains can sometimes be severe. Pregnant women often worry about the pain involved and the possible risks associated with child birth, followed by the period of convalescence after giving birth. Although women should be able to cope with pregnancy, labour and feeding their babies, men should also share in the responsibility of bringing up their children. Although an embryo is conceived in womens womb, there is also the father of the baby who has played an important role in its conception. So men should make certain for their wives comfort during child birth and be handy if anything should be urgently required. It is both an Islamic and a human duty of husbands to do their utmost for their pregnant wives to provide medical care and facilities for an easy delivery. A man should try to be with his wife after the birth of their child; but if unable to do so, he should phone her or send a relative to stay with her. He should try to bring her back home himself and help her with the housework so that she can get sufficient rest to regain her lost energy. A man, who treats his wife well, will be rewarded by Allah. The Prophet (SA) of Allah stated: The best of men is one who treats his wife well and I, amongst you, am the best man with regard to the good treatment of my wife.[257] Imam Sadiq (AS) stated: May Allah bless a man who creates a good relationship with his wife, because Allah has appointed man to be the guardian of his wife.[258] A man, who treats his wife well, will make the atmosphere of his family life warmer and will strengthen its foundations. His wife, in turn, would never forget her husbands love and affection. As a result the bonds of matrimony become stronger.'}]"></div>
